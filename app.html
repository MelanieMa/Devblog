        <h2>Getting started with coding</h2>

        Where do you start? There are many resources online, paid, unpaid, But which one is worth your time and effort and which one should you avoid.
        In this article I will try to guide you on your path to becoming a coder.</p>
        <p>
          Let's focus on Front End web Developer for now. This is a highly demanded skill and easily to learn online.
          It is easy for someone to start following courses on 10 different websites, and in the end never really finish anything.
          Many people get lost on this vast internet, and many people fall into roadblocks when it comes to coding.
          But have no worries, I will try to put out a general guide line for you to follow.
          One of the best free resources anyone can begin with is Free Code Camp. This website offers free education in Front end, Back end and has some
          project still in the making for future courses. you learn by doing and they encourage using google for their challanges,
          something you would do in real life aswell. They have an amazing community and forum where you can ask any question.
          Something I recommend when you start on Free Code Camp is when you come on the part of Javascript coding
          is to pause FFC and go to https://watchandcode.com, Gordon Zhu worked at Google, and out of frustration
          that no single course on the internet never really explained how javascript works but rather pushes the syntax
          in your head, he decided to change that. He started up watchandcode and teaches you how to code with Javascript
          by diving straight in and developing a to do list. This way you will learn how to think like a problem solver
          instead of a robot. Best part about his course is. The basic javascript course is completely free.
          And to add on to his awesomeness, he does a weekly office hour where you can skype with him as a group
          and ask him anything you dont understand or need.</p>

        <p>
          Another course you can do is the Microsoft Professional Program in Front-End Web Development on edX.</P>
          This course can be done for free by auditing the course. Or you can decide to pay for it and you will recieve
          a certification from Microsoft that you finished the course. (if you pass the grading) What I recommend is start <thead>
            course for free, and if you decide later on you want to have the certification you can still pay for the courses and get it anyway.
            I started this course and I must say it is really well build up.
          </thead>
