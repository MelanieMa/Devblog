            <h2>Getting started with coding</h2>
            <h5>02-03-2018</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>

              Where do you start? There are many resources online, paid, unpaid, But which one is worth your time and effort and which one should you avoid.
              In this article I will try to guide you on your path to becoming a coder.</p>
              <p>
                Let's focus on Front End web Developer for now. This is a highly demanded skill and easily to learn online.
                It is easy for someone to start following courses on 10 different websites, and in the end never really finish anything.
                Many people get lost on this vast internet, and many people fall into roadblocks when it comes to coding.
                But have no worries, I will try to put out a general guide line for you to follow.
                One of the best free resources anyone can begin with is Free Code Camp. This website offers free education in Front end, Back end and has some
                project still in the making for future courses. you learn by doing and they encourage using google for their challanges,
                something you would do in real life aswell. They have an amazing community and forum where you can ask any question.
                Something I recommend when you start on Free Code Camp is when you come on the part of Javascript coding
                is to pause FFC and go to https://watchandcode.com, Gordon Zhu worked at Google, and out of frustration
                that no single course on the internet never really explained how javascript works but rather pushes the syntax
                in your head, he decided to change that. He started up watchandcode and teaches you how to code with Javascript
                by diving straight in and developing a to do list. This way you will learn how to think like a problem solver
                instead of a robot. Best part about his course is. The basic javascript course is completely free.
                And to add on to his awesomeness, he does a weekly office hour where you can skype with him as a group
                and ask him anything you dont understand or need.</p>

                <p>
                  Another course you can do is the Microsoft Professional Program in Front-End Web Development on edX.</P>
                  This course can be done for free by auditing the course. Or you can decide to pay for it and you will recieve
                  a certification from Microsoft that you finished the course. (if you pass the grading) What I recommend is start <thead>
                    course for free, and if you decide later on you want to have the certification you can still pay for the courses and get it anyway.
                    I started this course and I must say it is really well build up.

                <h2 id="color/background">Background and color picking.</h2>
                <h5>04-03-2018</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  One of the hardest things for me personal, is picking a color cheme and background options!
                </p>

                <p>
                  There are many options when it comes to background. Images, just a color, parrallex images, fixed Images.
                  So many options! I will now explain how I did my current background, and where I picked my colors.
                  Luckily on the internet there are a lot of tools to help us.
                  For my gradient background I used a website called <a href="https://uigradients.com/#Venice">uigradients.com</a>, They have amazing
                  gradients already made for you, ready to use. Just copy and paste it in your desired styling. For my Title
                  I found this amazing <a href="https://www.gradient-animator.com/">gradient-animator website</a> You simply pick the coolors
                  that you want to have on your background, copy paste! and done
                  For my color scheme I go to <a href="https://coolors.co/">coolors.co</a>, They also have
                  tons of color shemes ready for you to use. If you rather use a real image as background
                  you can always go to <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a>. Photographers post
                  on this website each day tons of photos free of copyright for you to use. You can choose
                  to credit the photographer or not, that is up to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                  An important part after choosing colors is sticking to the colors. Don't change too much or you can go
                  into a color war!
                  I hope this helped a bit!
                </p>
